For your steganography app, the `requirements.txt` file should list all the necessary Python libraries needed for the project to run smoothly. Here’s a structured and professional format for your GitHub repository:


1) Create a `requirements.txt` File
  In your project’s root folder, create a new file named `requirements.txt`.  
  Add the necessary dependencies in a clean, version-specific format.  

  Example `requirements.txt` for my Project  

  tkinter  #GUI Interface (comes pre-installed with Python)
  pillow  #Image Processing
  cryptography  #Encryption and Decryption
  numpy  #Image Array Handling
  opencv-python  #Image Processing and Manipulation
  pyperclip  #Clipboard Handling

Note: `tkinter` comes pre-installed with Python, so it doesn’t need to be installed separately.  


 2) How to Install Dependencies?  
  To install all required libraries, users can run:  

  pip install -r requirements.txt

  This will automatically download and install all the dependencies needed for your project.


 3) Additional Notes  
  If you have specific versions of libraries that work best with your app, you can specify them like this:  

  pillow==9.0.1
  cryptography>=3.4.8

  To generate a fresh `requirements.txt` from an existing environment, run:  

  pip freeze > requirements.txt

  This ensures all current dependencies are captured.
